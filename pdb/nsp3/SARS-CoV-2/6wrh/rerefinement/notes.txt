1) Cl-1 A|506 does not have an anomalous peak while the other Cl-1, as well as the P and S atoms, do.  It also has an occupancy of about 0.7.  I changed it to W|106.

2) Phosphate A|504 should be marked as the alt conf .A to eliminate the clash with the water molecule it alternates with.

3) The new model contains hydrogen atoms build by Buster instead of Refmac.  The principal difference is that Buster only puts one, nitrogen bound, hydrogen atom on each Histidine side chain, instead of Refmac's two.  This change inadvertently changes the labeling chirality of a large number of CH2 groups.

4) I have done a ton of work seeking to understand Phosphate.  The habit is to define a Phosphate as PO4.  "PO4", however, is defined exactly as PO4-3, but that ionic state is impossible for a neutral pH solution.  (You need up around 12!)  At the pH of this crystal there has to be a mixture of H2PO4-1 and HPO4-2.  A|502 is buried and has clear enough hydrogen bonding partners that I'm pretty sure it is H2PO4-1.  A|504 is less clear, but it might be the same form.  Just to be simple I've decided to define them to be the same.  The TLC for H2PO4-1 is 2HP.
